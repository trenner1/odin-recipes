    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>These little taco-flavoured treats in wonton crusts make make mouth-watering, family-favorite appetizers.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 <sup>1/4</sup> cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off</li>
        <li><sup>3/4</sup>cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li><sup>1/4</sup>cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li><sup>3/4</sup>cup milk</li>
        <li><sup>1/2</sup> unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F degrees. Line a muffin pan with paper liners or spray with non-stick cooking
            spray. (I prefer to use non-stick cooking spray so the muffins get nice and crisp on the edges.)</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, break up the eggs with a whisk. Whisk in the honey, and then the milk. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the milk mixture
            and the melted butter to the dry ingredients. Whisk until just blended. Do not over-mix; it's okay if there
            are a few lumps. Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin pan, filling each cup about ¾ full. Bake
            for 17 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are set and golden. (Note that the muffins will not dome.) Cool the
            muffins for a few minutes in the pan, then serve warm.</li>
        <li>Note: If you'd prefer to make this as cornbread rather than muffins, spray an 8-inch square pan with
            non-stick cooking spray and bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If you'd prefer to make this as cornbread rather than muffins, spray an 8-inch square pan with non-stick
            cooking spray and bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Freezer-Friendly Instructions: Cornbread muffins taste best when served right out of the oven but can be
            frozen in an airtight container or sealable plastic bag for up to 3 months. Thaw for 3 for 4 hours on the
            counter-top before serving. To reheat, wrap them in aluminum foil and warm in a 350°F oven until hot.
            Alternatively, heat muffins in the microwave at 50 percent power for 30 to 45 seconds, or until just hot; do
            not overheat or muffins will get tough. </li>
    </ul>
