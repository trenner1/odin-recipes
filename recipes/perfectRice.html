    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Cooking rice is the most basic kitchen task in Asian cooking, yet many people have trouble creating fluffy white
        rice that is not mushy. </p> However, once you learn the tricks, youâ€™ll find that cooking perfect rice is the
    simplest thing to do!

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 <sup>3/4</sup> cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice with tap water, gently wash with hands, and discard the water. Repeat 3 times. Cover rice
            with water again and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer rice to a sieve and drain well.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rice to a medium dutch oven (or heavy pot with a tight fitting lid) and add water to cover.
        </li>
        <li>Cover and cook over medium heat. As soon as the water is boiling, turn to low heat. Cover and simmer for 12
            minutes. Uncover and take a quick peek at the rice. If there is water left, cover and let cook for another 1
            to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the the pot from the stove. Let rest, covered, for 10 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fluff the rice with a rice paddle and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You can use half the amount of water and substitute the other half for chicken broth for added flavour.</li>
        <li>You can have 'good enough' rice by skipping the rinsing and draining</li>
        <li>A great cast iron mini dutch oven makes this process very easy</li>
    </ul>
